BioFlow Lab — v2 Blueprint (Physiology Depth)

Goal:
Show distribution, prioritization, and failure modes of circulation.

1. System expansion

Single loop → multi-bed circulation

Add parallel vascular beds:

Brain

Heart

Kidneys

Peripheral / limbs

All share the same pump.

2. Each bed has

Resistance

Compliance

Flow share

Perfusion score

Simple. Reusable.

3. New dynamics

Flow competition between beds

Pressure redistribution

Pooling amplified in periphery

Reduced total perfusion under stress

Emergent, not scripted.

4. New state metrics

Bed-specific flow

Bed-specific pressure

Perfusion index (0–100)

Global perfusion efficiency

No oxygen yet — just flow adequacy.

5. User controls (additive)

Bed resistance sliders

Global vasoconstriction

Blood volume (mild hemorrhage)

Posture toggle (supine / standing)

6. Visual upgrades

Color-coded beds

Per-bed flow bars

Perfusion heat indicators

Optional “focus view” per organ

Still clean. Still fast.

7. Teaching moments enabled

Shock despite normal BP

Cold hands, preserved brain flow

Why organs compete

Why treating numbers fails

This is where intuition deepens.

8. Non-goals

No cellular metabolism

No gas exchange

No drug modeling

No autonomic reflexes (yet)

9. Success criteria

User predicts outcomes before sliders stop

Organ tradeoffs feel obvious

Clinically familiar patterns emerge

Next: v3 — oxygen debt, elevation, and failure cascades.
