BioFlow Lab — v3 Blueprint (Failure & Reality)

Goal:
Teach limits, cascades, and why interventions matter.

1. New core layer

Perfusion → Oxygen → Risk

Add a lightweight oxygen debt model:

Each bed accumulates debt when perfusion < demand

Debt decays when perfusion recovers

Debt thresholds trigger risk states

No cells. No biochemistry.

2. Elevation & gravity

Each bed gains:

Elevation relative to heart

Hydrostatic pressure offset

Enables:

Standing hypotension

Raised legs recovery

Limb ischemia under shock

3. Demand modeling

Each bed has:

Baseline demand

Stress multiplier

Demand rises before failure. Important.

4. Failure cascades

Low perfusion → debt rises

Debt → reduced compliance / resistance changes

System destabilizes naturally

No scripted collapse.

5. New user controls

Posture (continuous angle)

Limb elevation sliders

Stress level

Blood loss severity

Still bounded.

6. Visual language upgrade

Oxygen debt meters

Risk color gradients

Temporal “warning glow”

Timeline scrub (replay recent seconds)

7. What users learn now

BP ≠ survival

Timing matters

Compensation hides failure

Small delays kill systems

This is deep intuition.

8. Ethics & framing

Educational only

Explicit simplifications

No patient advice

Clear warning labels

9. Success criteria

Users can explain shock intuitively

Collapse feels earned, not magical

System teaches restraint, not panic
