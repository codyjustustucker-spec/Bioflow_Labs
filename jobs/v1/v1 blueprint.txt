BioFlow Lab — v1 Blueprint (MVP)

Goal:
Teach cardiovascular dynamics through immediate, honest visualization.
Ship fast. Stable. Intuitive.

1. System scope (locked)

Single closed-loop circulation

Compartments:

Heart (pump)

Arterial compliance

Peripheral resistance

Venous compliance (pooling reservoir)

No organs. No limbs. No oxygen yet.

2. State variables

Pressure (arterial, venous)

Flow rate

Volume (arterial, venous)

Heart rate

Stroke volume

Tracked continuously.

3. Core dynamics

Periodic pump function

Elastic storage (arteries, veins)

Resistive loss (periphery)

Volume conservation enforced

Non-linear resistance included.

4. User controls (sliders)

Heart rate

Stroke volume

Peripheral resistance

Vessel compliance

Venous pooling factor

Five. Max.

5. Visuals (must-have)

Animated flow loop

Pressure vs time plot

Flow waveform

Volume distribution bar (arterial vs venous)

Readable in 5 seconds.

6. Pathology toggles (educational)

Increased resistance (stenosis proxy)

Reduced compliance (stiff vessels)

Weak pump (heart failure proxy)

These are parameter presets, not modes.

7. UI philosophy

Dark, clean, scientific

No clutter

Units visible

Warnings instead of errors

8. Non-goals (important)

No diagnosis

No real patient data

No anatomical realism

No ML

No web version

9. Success criteria

User understands non-linearity

System breaks gracefully at extremes

Demo impresses in under 60 seconds

Next: v2 — multi-bed circulation + perfusion intuition.
